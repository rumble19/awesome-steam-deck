# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

---

This list is opinionated, and is not meant to be exhaustive. With that in mind, here are some types of contributions that I am looking for:
- New projects or alternatives to existing projects.
- Updates to dead links, outdated information, or alternatives to abandoned projects.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization or layout. 
- Edits for clarity, grammar or spelling. 
- In particular, I will not be merging any projects that could potentially cause harm to your deck, mainly overclocking utilities. I'm just not interested in the hassle. 


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
